## React + Webpack starter boilerplate

Possibly one of the simplest boilerplate to get started with React.<br>
This does NOT include ESLint, Sass, Prettier, etc.<br>
Reaons being that this boilerplate is meant for absolute starters.<br>
Many boilerplates offer a full developer experience, with lots of magic happening that might be overwhelming.

### `Tools used in this project`

[React](https://reactjs.org/)<br>
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)<br>
Webpack is used to bundle our project and to setup a local development server.<br>
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)<br>
This will transpile our code to parseable code for browsers.<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the project in development mode on localhost:3000.<br>
Webpack will bundle the entire project and cache the bundled files into memory.<br>
The bundled folder will be hidden at all times, to keep this more 'noob friendly'.<br>
When the webpack process is stopped, the files will be removed from memory.
